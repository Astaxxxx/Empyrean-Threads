Currently the main FRONT END elements which require completion are:

Index.html

Connecting all of the pages

CSS elements being correctly implemented

The sign Up page being both done to an acceptable degree and added to the GIT version of the project - THIS IS NOW DONE!

As of 00:21 21/11/2022: Majority of the websites Front end css has been fully changed to a more 'hip/modern' colour scheme and design scheme. Looks far better than prior version.

Basket still needs to be added and reworked to our actual CSS model
